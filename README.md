# Sample configuration for Promtail Heroku logs

Based on this blog post:
https://grafana.com/blog/2022/09/19/how-to-easily-configure-grafana-loki-and-promtail-to-receive-logs-from-heroku/

Note: in the blog post the `config.yaml` may be a bit hard to copy and paste leading to bad configurtations of the yaml. I was getting the following error:
```
 Unable to parse config: /etc/promtail/config.yml: yaml: line 20: did not find expected key
```
